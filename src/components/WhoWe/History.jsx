            <p>

                Noble In Christ Ministries is a Christian organization committed to spreading the gospel to the world. Each member, referred to as a Noble, is trained and discipled to lead others into full Christian maturity, as inspired by Matthew 28:19-20.
                <br />
                Noble In Christ Ministries operates through two key arms: God's Treasure House, its church division, and Noble In Christ Campus Church, its campus outreach. The church serves as a vital platform for fulfilling the ministry's vision by training believers to live out their God-given purpose, becoming a blessing to their world.
                <br />
                The church functions as both a spiritual building and an evangelical center, where every Noble is encouraged to actively participate for their personal growth in Christ. It is God’s workshop for making, training, building, raising, and sending people out to fulfill His mission.
                <br />
                Noble In Christ Ministries was founded by the Holy Spirit through our President and Senior Pastor, Rev. Austin Iyere Wonders, on May 6, 2006. Guided by the calling and vision given to our leader, our mission is encapsulated in the following statement:
                <br />
                "Revealing the love of God through the preaching of the gospel, works of charity, and the demonstration of God's power."
                <br />
                At Noble In Christ Ministries, we believe fully in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus; we believe the ultimate resurrection power of our lord Jesus christ, we are enthusiastic about bringing all men to the knowledge of Jesus via our evangelical approach to spreading the gospel.  We grow in the knowledge of Jesus, and edify ourselves through series of in-depth teachings, prayer sessions, training meetings, and evangelistic missions.
                <br />
                We are a purpose-driven church committed to spreading the gospel to the ends of the earth, serving as God's extension on earth—His outstretched arm. We believe the gifts of the Spirit are active in the life of every believer. Our services are a dynamic encounter with the fullness of the Spirit, expressed through the Word, prayer, prophecies, healings, spiritual songs and rejoicing.

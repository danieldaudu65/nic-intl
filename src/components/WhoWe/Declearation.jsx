                I win souls to Christ
                <br />
                I live in fellowship with God
                <br />
                I live by faith in the word of God.
                <br />
                I am a giver
                <br />
                I am prosperous
                <br />
                The power of the holy ghost is evident in my life.
                <br />
                I have the character of excellence
                <br />
                In Jesus name.
